# Ravenous

Codecademy featured a guided project in which we were instructed to develop a Yelp-like clone called "Ravenous". The requirements were to use React to create a user interface for the site that would allow users to search for and browse a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API, as well as filter and sort the restaurants.

This project was divided into four stages, each of which built on the functionality that had previously been implemented:

- [x] Create Static Components
- [x] Pass Information to Components
- [x] Set the State of Ravenous Components
- [ ] Interact with the Yelp API
