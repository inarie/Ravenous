# Ravenous

Codecademy featured a guided project in which we were instructed to develop a Yelp-like clone called "Ravenous". The requirements were to use React to create a user interface for the site that would allow users to search for and browse a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API, as well as filter and sort the restaurants.

This project was divided into four stages, each of which built on the functionality that had previously been implemented:

- [x] Create Static Components
- [x] Pass Information to Components
- [x] Set the State of Ravenous Components
- [x] Interact with the Yelp API

## Potential Features :zap:

- [ ] Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
- [ ] Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
- [ ] Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again
- [ ] Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
- [ ] Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
- [ ] Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input

## How To Use 🔧

From your command line, first clone Ravenous:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/inarie/Ravenous.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Ravenous

```

Then you can install the dependencies using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm start
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` and you will see the website running.
